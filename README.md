# PDF Dictionary

The purpose of this app is to provide users the ability to quickly look up the definition of a word without exiting tabs to search it up in Google.

## About

Our current goal is to be able to implement the app as a nonprofit, opensource google extension to use along side the default PDF reader in google chrome.

Eventually, we are looking towards being able to provide definitions for usage on websites, and not limited to PDF files.

- This project is for educational and experimental purposes.

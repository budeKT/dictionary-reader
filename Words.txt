Volleyball is a very intense sport. There are 2 teams on volleyball with 6 players on each side. Players on each side may only touch the ball once and may touch the ball again after a teammate sets the ball. Each side has a maximum of three touches on the  ball. The point is given to the other side if they touch the ball four times. The main point of this sport is to hit the ball on the opponent’s side of the court, and to defend the ball from hitting your team’s side of the court. 

There are many techniques involved to get the ball over the net, such as spiking, digging, and setting. Spiking uses the full force from the person to imply maximum speed and force over the net. Digging is a category of defending techniques used in volleyball. Digging can refer to the forearm pass, pancake, and many other techniques that you can use. The forearm pass, also known as a bump, is often used to receive and pass to a teammate to spike back. Blocking is also a very effective way to earn a point as it prevents the ball from getting past the net.

I was very fascinated by the article, as well as the sport itself. The techniques used to get the ball to the opposing team really got me thinking. Spiking to imply maximum force onto the ball can cause the ball into incredible speeds. I am very interested to see how the opposing team would be able to retrieve/block the ball. I’m also very attached to the people who play it because the net itself seems very tall and the players can jump over half their height. I find it very impressive because the tournament players have very strong forearms. Not only are they trained to be intensely fit but they also have phenomenal reflexes.
